        "This goal of this project is to analyze biodiversity data from the National Parks Service, particularly around various species observed in different national park locations.\n",
        "\n",
        "This project will scope, analyze, prepare, plot data, and seek to explain the findings from the analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are a few questions that this project has sought to answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "- What is the distribution of conservation status for species?\n",
        "- Are certain types of species more likely to be endangered?\n",
        "- Are the differences between species and their conservation status significant?\n",
        "- Which animal is most prevalent and what is their distribution amongst parks?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Data sources:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Both `Observations.csv` and `Species_info.csv` was provided by [Codecademy.com](https://www.codecademy.com).\n",

        "\n",
        "It's beneficial to create a project scope whenever a new project is being started. Four sections were created below to help guide the project's process and progress. The first section is the project goals, this section will define the high-level objectives and set the intentions for this project. The next section is the data, luckily in this project, data is already provided but still needs to be checked if project goals can be met with the available data. Thirdly, the analysis will have to be thought through, which include the methods and questions that are aligned with the project goals. Lastly, evaluation will help us build conclusions and findings from our analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Project Goals\n",
        "\n",
        "In this project the perspective will be through a biodiversity analyst for the National Parks Service. The National Park Service wants to ensure the survival of at-risk species, to maintain the level of biodiversity within their parks. Therefore, the main objectives as an analyst will be understanding characteristics about the species and their conservations status, and those species and their relationship to the national parks. Some questions that are posed:\n",
        "\n",
        "- What is the distribution of conservation status for species?\n",
        "- Are certain types of species more likely to be endangered?\n",
        "- Are the differences between species and their conservation status significant?\n",
        "- Which animal is most prevalent and what is their distribution amongst parks?\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data\n",
        "\n",
        "This project has two data sets that came with the package. The first `csv` file has information about each species and another has observations of species with park locations. This data will be used to analyze the goals of the project.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Analysis\n",
        "\n",
        "In this section, descriptive statistics and data visualization techniques will be employed to understand the data better. Statistical inference will also be used to test if the observed values are statistically significant. Some of the key metrics that will be computed include:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Distributions\n",
        "1. counts\n",
        "1. relationship between species\n",
        "1. conservation status of species\n",
        "1. observations of species in parks.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Evaluation\n",
        "\n",
        "Lastly, it's a good idea to revisit the goals and check if the output of the analysis corresponds to the questions first set to be answered (in the goals section). This section will also reflect on what has been learned through the process, and if any of the questions were unable to be answered. This could also include limitations or if any of the analysis could have been done using different methodologies.\n"

        "The project was able to make several data visualizations and inferences about the various species in four of the National Parks that comprised this data set.\n",
        "\n",
        "This project was also able to answer some of the questions first posed in the beginning:\n",
        "\n",
        "- What is the distribution of conservation status for species?\n",
        "    - The vast majority of species were not part of conservation.(5,633 vs 191)\n",
        "- Are certain types of species more likely to be endangered?\n",
        "    - Mammals and Birds had the highest percentage of being in protection.\n",
        "- Are the differences between species and their conservation status significant?\n",
        "    - While mammals and Birds did not have significant difference in conservation percentage, mammals and reptiles exhibited a statistically significant difference.\n",
        "- Which animal is most prevalent and what is their distribution amongst parks?\n",
        "    - the study found that bats occurred the most number of times and they were most likely to be found in Yellowstone National Park.\n"

        "This dataset only included observations from the last 7 days which prohibits analyze changes over time. It would be curious to see how the conservation status for various species changes over time. Another piece that is missing is the Area of each park, it can be assumed that Yellowstone National Park might be much larger than the other parks which would mean that it would exhibit more observations and greater biodiversity. Lastly, if precise locations were recorded, the spatial distribution of the species could also be observed and test if these observations are spatially clustered."
