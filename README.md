# 🐾 **Endangered Species Analysis in U.S. National Parks** 🌲🌿

---

## 🌟 **Project Overview**
This project focuses on analyzing data from the **National Parks Service (NPS)** about **endangered species** found across various U.S. national parks. By diving into the conservation statuses of these species, we aim to identify patterns, explore trends, and understand which types of species are most at risk. 🦉🐢🐻

---

## 🗂️ **Project Objectives**
- 📊 **Analyze conservation statuses** of species in national parks.
- 🔎 **Identify patterns and themes** among endangered species.
- 🧹 **Clean and prepare** the dataset for analysis.
- 📈 **Visualize data** with engaging and informative plots.
- 📝 **Pose and answer critical questions** about species endangerment.
- 🗣️ **Share actionable insights** with stakeholders and conservationists.

---

## 🔑 **Key Questions**
1. **What proportion of species are endangered, threatened, or at risk?**
2. **Do certain types of species (mammals, birds, reptiles, etc.) face higher endangerment rates?**
3. **Are there parks with higher concentrations of endangered species?**
4. **What conservation efforts appear most effective?**
5. **Has there been any improvement in species status over time?**

---

## 🛠️ **Tools & Technologies**
- **Python** 🐍 *(pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy)*
- **Jupyter Notebooks** 📓 for interactive data exploration.
- **Plotly** 📊 for dynamic visualizations.
- **GitHub** 🗃️ for version control and collaboration.

## 📢 **Findings & Insights**
✅ **Mammals and birds** are among the most endangered categories.  
✅ Certain parks, like **Yellowstone** and **Yosemite**, have higher counts of endangered species.  
✅ **Conservation efforts** targeting specific species have shown measurable improvements.  
✅ Patterns indicate that **habitat loss** is the leading cause of species decline.

## 🎯 **Next Steps**
- Expand the analysis to include **climate change impacts**. 🌡️
- Integrate **historical data** to assess long-term trends. 📆
- Develop a **dashboard** for real-time endangered species tracking. 🖥️
